<analysis>**original_problem_statement**: 
The user wants to deploy a project from the GitHub repository . This repository contains BlockView, a full-stack application for blockchain analytics, which includes a React frontend, a TypeScript/Fastify backend, and Telegram bot integration.

The primary goal is to make the application fully functional, focusing on its core feature: smart alerts sent via a Telegram bot. The project evolved through several phases based on user feedback:
1.  **Initial Deployment & Bug Fixes**: The first phase involved deploying the app, fixing critical bugs like an infinite analyzing state on the frontend, and non-functional Telegram alerts.
2.  **Infrastructure Workaround**: A platform-level issue was blocking Telegram webhooks. A polling mechanism was implemented as a workaround to make the bot functional.
3.  **UI/UX Interpretation Layer**: The user reported that the app had zero practical value because it showed raw, empty results. The agent implemented a detailed UI contract to provide honest empty states, which explain *what was checked* rather than just showing nothing. This was done for the Tokens, Wallets, and Alerts pages.
4.  **P0 Critical Engine Fix**: The user then identified the root cause of the empty results: the backend's analytics engine was completely disconnected from the blockchain. The data indexer was disabled and lacked an RPC connection. The final and most critical work was to connect the engine to live on-chain data.

**User's preferred language**: Russian. The next agent **MUST** respond in Russian.

**what currently exists?**
The application is fully deployed and running. The UI has been significantly overhauled to provide a valuable user experience with clear interpretations, even for empty states. Most importantly, the backend's analytics engine is now **connected to live on-chain data**.

-   **Live Data Pipeline**: An ERC20 indexer job is now active, using user-provided Infura and Ankr RPC URLs with load balancing. It continuously fetches on-chain  events and populates the MongoDB database (,  collections).
-   **Live Metrics UI**: The  and  now display real-time, aggregated data from the blockchain. The  for tokens like USDT shows live metrics (e.g., thousands of transfers, active wallets, and total net flow in USD).
-   **Market Discovery**: The  has been transformed from a static page into a discovery dashboard that shows the Top Active Tokens based on live on-chain activity.
-   **Advanced UI**: The Interpretation Layer and Alerts UX have been fully implemented according to the user's detailed specifications, making the UI intuitive and insight-first.
-   **Telegram Workaround**: A polling worker () remains active to ensure the Telegram bot is responsive.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working**: The agent was implementing **Signals Generation**. Now that the backend has access to a live stream of transfer data, the next logical step is to generate analytical signals (e.g., Consistent Buying, Large Transfer) based on that data. This requires creating a baseline of normal activity and detecting deviations.
-   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done**: N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?**: Backend testing agent (to verify signal generation logic and API responses) followed by frontend testing agent (to ensure signals are displayed correctly in the UI).
-   **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**: 
- **Issue 1: Infrastructure - Ingress blocks all external API calls (P0 - Workaround in place)**
  - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: This is a platform-level routing issue where external requests to  endpoints return a 404 error. The current polling mechanism is a temporary fix. Solving the root Ingress problem will allow for a more robust and standard webhook-based architecture for Telegram and future integrations.
  - **Attempted fixes**: The previous agent confirmed it's an infrastructure issue beyond its control. A polling worker was implemented as a workaround.
  - **Next debug checklist**: The issue is blocked on platform-level support. The next agent should proceed with the current polling workaround and not attempt to fix the ingress.
  - **Status**: BLOCKED

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1: Complete Signals Generation with Baseline Calculation (P0)**
    -   **Where to resume**: The agent created  and added an API endpoint in . The next step is to implement the core logic in . This involves:
        1.  Creating a job or service to calculate a baseline of activity (e.g., average hourly transfer volume/count) for tracked tokens.
        2.  Implementing the logic to compare current activity against this baseline to generate signals like , , or .
        3.  Ensuring the API endpoint returns these generated signals.
        4.  Updating the  component on the frontend to fetch and display these live signals.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?**: This will activate the Recent Signals block on the  with real, data-driven insights, which is a core value proposition of the application.
    -   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Both

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks**:
    - **(P1) Connect B2, B3, B4 Analytics to Live Data**: The UI for Who is driving this activity?, Related Wallet Clusters, and Smart Money Activity is ready, but the backend logic is not yet connected to the live data. This requires implementing the analysis engines for these features using the indexed  data.
    - **(P2) Implement Net Flow for Non-Stablecoins**: The current price service is hardcoded for stablecoins. To calculate Net Flow for assets like WETH, a real price oracle (e.g., CoinGecko API, Chainlink) needs to be integrated.
    - **(P3) Confidence Score Explanation**: Add a tooltip to explain that the Confidence score reflects data completeness, not analysis quality.

- **Future Tasks**:
    - **Advanced Alert Parameters UI**: Enhance the  with more granular controls.
    - **Alert Feedback Loop**: Implement a system to reduce alert fatigue.
    - Remove the Telegram polling worker once the infrastructure issue is resolved.
    - Clean up the WebSocket 403 error.

**Completed work in this session**
- **P0 Critical Fix: Connected Engine to Live Data**: Diagnosed and fixed the disconnected backend by enabling and configuring the ERC20 indexer with user-provided RPC URLs and load balancing. The application now processes real-time blockchain data.
- **Live Metrics Implementation**: Created backend APIs () and frontend components () to display live on-chain metrics (transfer count, active wallets, net flow) on the .
- **Market Page Rework (Discovery Engine)**: Transformed the  into a discovery tool by adding a Top Active Tokens list, powered by a new backend endpoint that aggregates live data.
- **Alerts UX Overhaul (A1-A3)**: Completely redesigned the alert creation modal and alerts page to be insight-first, replacing technical jargon with user-friendly descriptions and adding a notification preview.
- **UI Interpretation Layer (Tokens & Wallets)**: Implemented the user's detailed UI contract to show honest empty states that explain what was analyzed, which was a critical step in making the product feel trustworthy and valuable.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- **Issue recurrence in previous fork**: N/A
- **Recurrence count**: N/A
- **Status**: N/A

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Data Ingestion**: An active ERC20 indexer () polls Ethereum RPC endpoints, fetches  event logs, and stores them in MongoDB (). Another job normalizes this data into a  collection.
- **On-Demand Aggregation**: New API endpoints (, ) perform real-time aggregation queries against the MongoDB  collection to generate live metrics for the UI.
- **RPC Load Balancing**: The backend rotates between multiple RPC URLs (, ) to distribute load and enhance the reliability of the data indexer.

**key DB schema**
-   :  - Raw ERC20 event logs from the blockchain.
-   :  - Normalized transfer data used for all analytics.
-   :  - Tracks the last synced block number for the indexer.

**All files of reference**
-   : The core data ingestion engine.
-   : Contains the new API endpoints for serving live data.
-   : The file for the current in-progress task.
-   : The primary page displaying live token analytics.
-   : The market discovery page.
-   : The redesigned, user-friendly modal for creating alerts.

**Areas that need refactoring**
-   The  is a placeholder and only handles a few hardcoded stablecoins. It needs to be replaced with a robust price oracle integration to support Net Flow calculations for all tokens.
-   The Telegram polling worker () is a temporary solution and should be removed if the platform's Ingress issue is resolved.

**key api endpoints**
-   : **(NEW & LIVE)** Returns a real-time activity snapshot for a given token address.
-   : **(NEW & LIVE)** Returns the most active tokens on the network, powering the market discovery page.
-   : The endpoint for the redesigned insight-first alert creation flow.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **You MUST respond in Russian.**
-   The core problem of the app having no real data is **SOLVED**. The indexer is running, the database is populated with live on-chain data, and the main UI pages reflect this.
-   The user's primary focus is now on building out the analytical features that consume this live data.
-   Your immediate task is to complete the **Signals Generation** feature. This is the top priority and involves implementing baseline calculations to make the Recent Signals block functional.
-   After signals, the next step is to power the remaining analytics blocks (B2, B3, B4) with the live data.

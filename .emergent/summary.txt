<analysis>**original_problem_statement**:
The user wants to deploy a project from the GitHub repository . This repository contains BlockView, a full-stack application for blockchain analytics, which includes a React frontend, a TypeScript/Fastify backend, and Telegram bot integration.

The primary goal is to make the application fully functional, focusing on its core feature: smart alerts sent via a Telegram bot. The project evolved through several phases based on user feedback:
1.  **Initial Deployment & Bug Fixes**: The first phase involved deploying the app, fixing critical bugs like an infinite analyzing state on the frontend, and non-functional Telegram alerts.
2.  **Infrastructure Workaround**: A platform-level issue was blocking Telegram webhooks. A polling mechanism was implemented as a workaround to make the bot functional.
3.  **UI/UX Interpretation Layer**: The user reported that the app had zero practical value because it showed raw, empty results. The agent implemented a detailed UI contract to provide honest empty states, which explain *what was checked* rather than just showing nothing.
4.  **P0 Critical Engine Fix**: The user identified that the backend's analytics engine was completely disconnected from the blockchain. This was fixed by connecting the engine to live on-chain data.
5.  **P1 Semantic Layer**: After getting live data, the user pointed out the app was still empty of meaning. The agent then implemented a semantic layer of analytics to generate actual insights (e.g., activity concentration, baseline deviations for signals) instead of just showing raw numbers. This was completed for the .
6.  **P1 Synchronization**: The current goal is to apply the same semantic layer and UI/UX standards to the  to ensure consistency.

**User's preferred language**: Russian. The next agent **MUST** respond in Russian.

**what currently exists?**
The application is fully deployed and connected to live on-chain data via an ERC20 indexer. The  is feature-complete, displaying a rich semantic layer of analytics with data-driven interpretations for activity drivers, signals, and smart money. A CoinGecko integration provides live prices for non-stablecoins.

The backend has been extended with new analytics services (, ) and corresponding API endpoints to power both the  and . The backend APIs for the  have been created and tested. Work to update the  frontend components to consume these new APIs is in progress.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working**: The agent was synchronizing the  with the  by updating the frontend components (, , , ) to use the newly created backend analytics APIs. This is a critical step to ensure both core pages of the application share the same high-quality interpretation layer.
-   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done**: N (Backend APIs were tested via , but a full E2E frontend test was not completed due to repeated memory limit crashes.)
-   **Which testing method agent to use?**: both (Start with  or  to verify the UI on , then use  for regression if any backend changes are needed.)
-   **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1: Infrastructure - Ingress blocks external API calls (P0)**
    -   **Why fix this issue**: A platform-level issue blocks webhooks. The current polling mechanism for Telegram is a workaround.
    -   **Status**: BLOCKED (Blocked on platform support. Continue using the polling workaround).
-   **Issue 2: System Instability - Repeated Memory Crashes (P1)**
    -   **Why fix this issue**: The agent was repeatedly interrupted by  errors, causing pod termination. This is a high-priority issue as it severely hinders development and testing, especially for frontend tasks like taking screenshots.
    -   **Next debug checklist**: Work in smaller, incremental steps. Prioritize  or python script-based testing over resource-intensive screenshot tests. If crashes persist, investigate potential memory leaks in the backend or frontend processes.
    -   **Status**: NOT STARTED

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1: P1 - WalletsPage Frontend Finalization and Verification (P0 - HIGHEST PRIORITY)**
    -   **Where to resume**: The backend APIs for wallet analytics are complete. The frontend components on  (, , , etc.) were being updated. The next agent MUST verify that all these components are correctly wired to their respective APIs (, , , ), handle loading/empty/data states correctly, and display the interpretation layer text provided by the API.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?**: The  will be brought to feature parity with the , providing a consistent and meaningful user experience across the application's core entities.
    -   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: both

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks**:
    - **(P2) Rework MarketPage into a Discovery Layer**: Transform the  from a watchlist duplicate into a true discovery tool. It should feature Top Active Tokens, Emerging Signals, and New Actors, with a clear CTA to add items to the user's personal watchlist.
- **Future Tasks**:
    - **(P3) Alert Feedback Loop**: Implement a system to reduce alert fatigue (e.g., prompting the user to adjust sensitivity after repeated alerts).
    - **(P3) Price Alerts**: Add a new alert type for when a token's price crosses a specific threshold.
    - **(Backlog) Remove Telegram polling worker**: Decommission the workaround once the platform Ingress issue is resolved.
    - **(Backlog) Clean up WebSocket 403 error**: Investigate and fix the persistent WebSocket connection error visible in the browser console.

**Completed work in this session**
- **P0 Critical Data Logic Fixes**:
  - : Fixed calculation (was sorting string, now number), showing correct multi-million dollar values.
  - : Fixed calculation to be a true directional flow (inflow - outflow) instead of total volume.
- **P0.5 UI/API Contract Synchronization**: Found and fixed a critical bug on  where  showed all zeros due to an Axios timeout and incorrect data handling, successfully connecting the UI to the live backend data.
- **P1 Semantic Layer Implementation ()**:
  - Rewrote backend services to provide analytical interpretations, not just raw data.
  - Implemented logic for **Activity Drivers** (concentration), **Signals** (baseline deviation), and **Smart Money** (volume share, fixing a >100% share bug).
- **P2 CoinGecko Integration**: Integrated a price oracle for non-stablecoin price data.
- **P2/P3 UI Enhancements**: Added an Advanced Alert Parameters UI to the  and a  component.
- **P1 WalletsPage Backend**: Created the full suite of backend analytics APIs and services for the  to mirror the  functionality.
- **Documentation**: Generated  and  and updated .

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Semantic Layer**: A backend layer that translates raw blockchain data into human-readable interpretations and insights (e.g., activity is moderately concentrated, unusual accumulation detected). This logic resides primarily in  and .
-   **Baseline Deviation**: A method for signal generation where current activity is compared against a historical baseline (e.g., 7-day average) to detect statistically significant anomalies.
-   **Concentration Analysis**: A technique used in  to calculate the share of trading volume controlled by top wallets, which determines if activity is crowd-driven or concentrated.
-   **Price Oracle**: Use of the CoinGecko API as an external data source for real-time cryptocurrency prices.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **You MUST respond in Russian.**
-   The user is highly technical and product-focused. The main priority is building a semantic layer that provides real insights, not just raw data. The honest empty state pattern (explaining *what* was checked) is critical to the user.
-   The immediate task is to finalize the  frontend, ensuring it matches the  in quality and functionality. This was interrupted by memory crashes, so you must verify the state of all components on that page.
-   The system has been unstable due to memory limits. Be cautious with resource-intensive operations like screenshots. Prefer  and lightweight tests to verify functionality before attempting full UI tests.

**What agent forgot to execute**
The agent was in the process of a critical task—updating all frontend components on —when it was repeatedly halted by memory errors. The task is therefore incomplete and must be picked up and verified from the start by the next agent. The specific components are , , , and .</analysis>
